    "## Building a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) Tool for Web Browsing and Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This cookbook is for educational purposes only. Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and service terms when using web search and scraping technologies. This cookbook will restrict the search to openai.com domain to retrieve the public information to illustrate the concepts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have a knowledge cutoff date, which means they lack information about events that occurred after that point. In scenarios where the most recent data is essential, it's necessary to provide LLMs with access to current web information to ensure accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will build a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) tool using Python to overcome this limitation. Our goal is to create a system that provides up-to-date answers in your application, including the most recent developments such as the latest product launches by OpenAI. By integrating web search capabilities with an LLM, we'll enable the model to generate responses based on the latest information available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can use any publicly available search APIs, we'll utilize Google's Custom Search API to perform web searches. The retrieved information from the search results will be processed and passed to the LLM to generate the final response through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB)** tools allow users to perform web browsing tasks programmatically. In this notebook, we'll create a BYOB tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**#1. Set Up a Search Engine:** Use a public search API, such as Google's Custom Search API, to perform web searches and obtain a list of relevant search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#2. Build a Search Dictionary:** Collect the title, URL, and a summary of each web page from the search results to create a structured dictionary of information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#3. Generate a RAG Response:** Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by passing the gathered information to the LLM, which then generates a final response to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "**For our own usecase**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add additional steps to select relevant webpages\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Parsed relevant webpages with BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Generate a yaml file\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The followup *generate function from yaml* process is the same as the data process pipeline on existing db (`openapis`)\n"

    "You are an expert API documentation assistant. Your task is to assist users in finding API endpoint information using provided search terms, synthesize the relevant details from online sources, and generate a YAML configuration for the given API endpoint. The YAML should include standard fields such as name, description, method, endpoint URL, parameters, and any other necessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "1. Understand user endpoint search query, and find reliable and updated documentation for the specified API endpoint based on the google search term and its search result.\n",
    "2. Extract the relevant information, including endpoint details, HTTP method, parameters, and usage examples.\n",
    "3. Generate a YAML configuration based on openapi 3.1.0 looking like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Replace `<placeholders>` with the extracted API information.\n",
    "- Replace `paths` part based on the valid endpoint you found, do not miss operationId\n",
    "- Ensure the YAML structure is complete and adheres to standard YAML formatting rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Guidelines:**\n",
    "- Validate the endpoint and parameter descriptions against the official API documentation.\n",
    "- Always ensure the output is tailored to the user’s use case.\n",

      "Summary: To implement a search feature in Confluence using the REST API, utilize the endpoint GET /rest/api/search with CQL (Confluence Query Language). You can specify criteria like parent pages to get results from any depth of child pages. For example, you could use: `cql=parent=123 and text~{\"getting%20started\"} and type=page`. This setup allows searching all descendants under a specific parent page. If immediate children only are returned, ensure your CQL is correct and that the Confluence server version supports the desired functionality.\n",

      "Summary: In the Atlassian Developer Community, a user faced issues with expanding comments and labels while using the Confluence Cloud REST API search endpoint. They were attempting to use the expand parameter but found it ignored in their request. Another user clarified that they mixed up endpoints: they should use `/wiki/rest/api/content/search` for the specified expand parameters instead of `/wiki/rest/api/search`. The issue was resolved by adopting the correct endpoint or adjusting the expand parameter.\n",
