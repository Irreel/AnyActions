    "**Disclaimer: This cookbook is for educational purposes only. Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and service terms when using web search and scraping technologies. This cookbook will restrict the search to openai.com domain to retrieve the public information to illustrate the concepts.**\n",

    "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have a knowledge cutoff date, which means they lack information about events that occurred after that point. In scenarios where the most recent data is essential, it's necessary to provide LLMs with access to current web information to ensure accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will build a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) tool using Python to overcome this limitation. Our goal is to create a system that provides up-to-date answers in your application, including the most recent developments such as the latest product launches by OpenAI. By integrating web search capabilities with an LLM, we'll enable the model to generate responses based on the latest information available online.\n",

      "Summary: The Confluence Cloud REST API provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developers, including authentication, content management (attachments, comments, labels, properties, permissions), space management, and user management. It supports both REST and GraphQL APIs, allowing for dynamic interactions with content and settings. The API documentation includes guides, changelogs, and support resources. Users can rate the utility of the page, access system status updates, and review privacy policies. Overall, the Confluence API facilitates tailored content management and integration capabilities.\n",

A user seeks to replicate the search functionality of Confluence by making API calls that return page titles matching a query under a specified parent page ID. The suggested API endpoint is `/rest/api/search` with a CQL query to filter results based on the parent page. However, an issue arises where the search only returns immediate children. Follow-up guidance is offered to troubleshoot the CQL and ensure it covers all nested levels.\n",

Users have pointed out that although content statuses (like archived and current) can be searched using CQL, there is no direct way to query custom content states (like rough draft or in progress). While a CQL was attempted to query by a content property representing published states, it led to errors. Further, users confirmed that there is no current method to filter by these custom states and encouraged filing feature requests for this functionality on Atlassianâ€™s public Jira.\n",

They mention using the v2 API for page title search but require a solution to search by keywords. Community leaders recommend using the CQL (Confluence Query Language) with the v1 API endpoint for content search. They confirm that the CQL search results include content IDs, which can help in constructing URLs for downloading and redirecting content. The user also explores building URLs based on API responses and queries the safety and current status of the API mentioned.\n",

      "Summary: The Confluence API discussion revolves around retrieving a page by its title after the deprecation of the v1 API content call. Users are advised to use the search content endpoint with CQL queries instead, despite concerns over slower performance and migration challenges. Specific issues arise with titles containing special characters, leading to bugs and errors. A workaround involves sanitizing queries to use the CONTAINS operator for special characters. Recently, updates have been made that resolved some issues with API calls for retrieving pages by title.\n",

      "Summary: The Confluence API has a default limit on search results. When using the REST API with Confluence Query Language (CQL), results are capped at 50 if the \"body\" expansion is included. The maximum can reach 1000 without any expansions or up to 200 with other expansions. To retrieve more results, avoid using the \"body\" expansion in your query. For instance, you can modify your API call to include only \"space\" and \"history.lastUpdated\" for a higher limit.\n",

    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have a knowledge cutoff and may not be aware of recent events. To provide them with the latest information, you can build a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) tool using Python. This tool retrieves current web data and feeds it to the LLM, enabling up-to-date responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**#1 Set Up a Search Engine:** Use a public search API, like Google's Custom Search API, to perform web searches and obtain a list of relevant search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#2 Build a Search Dictionary:** Collect the title, URL, and a summary of each web page from the search results to create a structured dictionary of information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#3. Generate a RAG Response:** Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by passing the gathered information to the LLM, which then generates a final response to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you enhance the LLMs ability to provide up-to-date answers in your application that include the most recent developments, such as the latest product launches by OpenAI."
