    "## Building a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) Tool for Web Browsing and Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This cookbook is for educational purposes only. Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and service terms when using web search and scraping technologies. This cookbook will restrict the search to openai.com domain to retrieve the public information to illustrate the concepts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have a knowledge cutoff date, which means they lack information about events that occurred after that point. In scenarios where the most recent data is essential, it's necessary to provide LLMs with access to current web information to ensure accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will build a Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB) tool using Python to overcome this limitation. Our goal is to create a system that provides up-to-date answers in your application, including the most recent developments such as the latest product launches by OpenAI. By integrating web search capabilities with an LLM, we'll enable the model to generate responses based on the latest information available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can use any publicly available search APIs, we'll utilize Google's Custom Search API to perform web searches. The retrieved information from the search results will be processed and passed to the LLM to generate the final response through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bring Your Own Browser (BYOB)** tools allow users to perform web browsing tasks programmatically. In this notebook, we'll create a BYOB tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**#1. Set Up a Search Engine:** Use a public search API, such as Google's Custom Search API, to perform web searches and obtain a list of relevant search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#2. Build a Search Dictionary:** Collect the title, URL, and a summary of each web page from the search results to create a structured dictionary of information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**#3. Generate a RAG Response:** Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by passing the gathered information to the LLM, which then generates a final response to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "**For our own usecase**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add additional steps to select relevant webpages\n",

    "- Parsed relevant webpages with BeautifulSoup\n",

Users are prompted to transition to the v2 API, specifically leveraging the search content endpoint with CQL (Common Query Language) for fetching pages by title. Challenges arise when handling special characters in titles, leading to errors in requests. Workarounds involve sanitizing queries and using the CONTAINS operator instead of EQUALS.
